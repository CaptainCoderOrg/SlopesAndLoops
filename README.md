# May 2024: Special Platforms - Slopes and Loops
Special Platforms: Slopes and Loops

## What is Mechanically Challenged?

Mechanically Challenged is a monthly challenge hosted by MooNiZZ and Captain
Coder's Academy in which members of the community recreate different mechanics
found in games! The goal is to create a library of references and examples for
these mechanics in as many different engines and languages as possible.

## May 2024 - Special Platforms: Slopes and Loops

Mechanically Challenged is a monthly challenge hosted by MooNiZZ and Captain
Coder's Academy in which members of the community recreate different mechanics
found in games! The goal is to create a library of references and examples for
these mechanics in as many different engines and languages as possible.

Examples: [Sloped Platform](sonic-sloped-platform.gif) | [Loop Success](sonic-success-loop.gif) | [Loop Failure](sonic-fail-loop.gif)

This month, you are challenged to write an implementation for sloped platforms,
looping platforms, or both! A few things to notice from the examples:

* The character sprite adjust to the angle of the slope
* The character's velocity is affected by the slope: they slow down going up and
  speed up moving down.
* The character will slide down a slope that is too steep.
* The character cannot make it through a loop if their velocity is not great
  enough

Both 2D and 3D submissions are welcome! Additionally, it is up to you how you
choose to implement this mechanic. However, entries that focus on simplicity,
modularity, and code reuse are more likely to win an *Educational Mechanic*
prize!

## Prizes

Entries submitted before *June 1st 2024* will be eligible for an
*Educational Mechanic* prize!

Two $50 <b>Educational Mechanic</b> prizes will be awarded: one by Captain Coder
and one by MooNiZZ. The selection process is at the sole discretion of the
judge. The judges will be looking for clean implementations that can be utilized
by new developers to implement the mechanic.

**Note**: Only one entry per person is eligible to win.

Eligibility Information: [LINK](Eligibility.md)

## How to Participate

1. Implement a solution using any language / engine / tools you would like!
2. Create a fork of this repository
3. Within your fork, create a folder that follows the following structure:
   `{EngineName}/{LanguageName}/{UserName}`

For example, if I were using `Godot 3` using `C#` and my username was `The
Captain Coder`, I would create a folder called `Godot3/CSharp/TheCaptainCoder`.

4. Add a minimal version of your solution to that folder. This is typically an
   importable package that contains the necessary source code, assets, and demo
   scene(s).
5. Add a README.md to your folder that explains how to utilize your solution
   (e.g. how to import and see the demo)
6. Create a Pull Request with your solution
7. We may ask you to make minor modifications to your folder names during the PR
   process
8. ???
9.  Profit!
